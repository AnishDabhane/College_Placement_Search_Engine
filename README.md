# College_Placement_Search_Engine
This project is a web application designed to streamline the college placement search process. It tackles the challenge of navigating through individual college placement reports (often in PDF format) by:

#### Parsing PDFs: The application extracts relevant placement information from college PDFs.
#### Centralized Database: This extracted data is stored in a central database for efficient searching.
#### Filterable Search: Users can search for specific placement details using various filters, saving them time and effort.

In essence, it acts as a powerful search engine specifically for college placement data, making it easier for students to find the right opportunities.
